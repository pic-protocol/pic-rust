# pic-pca

PCA (Provenance Causal Authority) and PoC (Proof of Continuity) types for the PIC Protocol.

**Status:** Experimental

---

## About

This crate is part of the reference implementation of the PIC Protocol as defined in the [PIC Specification](https://github.com/pic-protocol/pic-spec).

The **PIC Model** is original theoretical work created by **Nicola Gallo**.

This implementation is developed and maintained by **Nitro Agility S.r.l.**

---

## Overview

This crate provides the core data structures for the PIC Protocol:

- **PCA (Provenance Causal Authority)**: The causally derived authority available to an Executor at each hop
- **PoC (Proof of Continuity)**: Non-forgeable proof demonstrating valid causal continuation
